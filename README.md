# Employee Tracker
> Command line interface for tracking employees within a company.

This was a homework assignment where we were challenged to architect and build a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.

## Completed
* Design the following database schema containing three tables:
![Database Schema](assets/schema.png)    
* Build a command-line application that at a minimum allows the user to:
  * Add departments, roles, employees
  * View departments, roles, employees
  * Update employee roles
  * Update employee managers
  * View employees by manager
  * Delete departments, roles, and employees
  * View the total utilized budget of a department -- ie the combined salaries of all employees in that department
* Use the [MySQL](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql) NPM package to connect to your MySQL database and perform queries.
* Use [InquirerJs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/0.2.3) NPM package to interact with the user via the command-line.

## Usage 
to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in the company
To organize and plan the business
How do you deliver this? Here are some guidelines:

Use the MySQL NPM package to connect to your MySQL database and perform queries.

Use InquirerJs NPM package to interact with the user via the command-line.

Use console.table to print MySQL rows to the console. There is a built-in version of console.table, but the NPM package formats the data a little better for our purposes.

You may wish to have a separate file containing functions for performing specific SQL queries you'll need to use. Could a constructor function or a class be helpful for organizing these?

You will need to perform a variety of SQL JOINS to complete this assignment, and it's recommended you review the week's activities if you need a refresher on this.
